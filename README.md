# LACC-PCR-docAutomation
Prospective Client Review Letter using Word and Documate.
Documate is a document automation software that gives both front-end and back-end an ease of service throughout the entire experience.
All the client sees is the finished interview which can be broken down into relavent chunks, making them easily digestible. The interface is intuitive for users to give accurate and complete information. Once the user has succussfully completed the interview, they are allowed to download a finished copy in .doc or .pdf format.

----------------

From the dev side there are 3 general steps to this process. The first is side-by-side comparison of the finished document and real-time creation of the expected variables in documate's workflow. After you have added the supportive logic to the variables and pages, the next step is to import the variables into your document, again adding the supportive conditional logic while keeping the format as close to the original document as possible. The last step is testing and debugging using user stories to make sure there are no edgecases depending on potential answer variety.
